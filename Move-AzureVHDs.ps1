.SYNOPSIS
   Moves all the virtual machines in the specified cloud service to the specified virtual
   network.
.DESCRIPTION
   This script is commonly used to move virtual machines from a legacy virtual network 
   to a new regional virtual network so that you can take advantage of new capabilities 
   such as internal load balancing and virtual network to virtual network connectivity.
   
   Please note that A8/A9 virtual machine sizes also require regional virtual networks but
   have three additional requirements.  First, they need to be provisioned inside a cloud
   service that is created with a new affinity group (or by location).  Second, the existing
   virtual machine instance needs to be deleted and re-provisioned as A8/A9.  You cannot
   re-size existing VM instances to A8/A9.  Third, a cloud service can only contain virtual
   machines of size A8/A9.  You can not mix A8/A9 with other virtual machine sizes in the same
   cloud service.  Therefore, please use the Resize-AzureVM cmdlet to resize virtual machines.
